Added in: v4.9.0

pnpm supports command line tab-completion for Bash, Zsh, and Fish shells.

To setup autocompletion, run:

```text
pnpm install-completion
```

The CLI will ask for which shell to generate the autocompletion script. Alternatively, the target shell may be specified in the command line (since v5.15.0):

```text
pnpm install-completion zsh
```
