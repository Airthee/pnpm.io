Using a [standalone script](https://github.com/pnpm/self-installer#readme):

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pnpm/self-installer/master/install.js | node
```

Via npx:

```sh
npx pnpm add -g pnpm
```

Once you first installed pnpm, you can upgrade it using pnpm:

```sh
pnpm add -g pnpm
```

> Do you wanna use pnpm on CI servers? See: [Continuous Integration](continuous-integration).
